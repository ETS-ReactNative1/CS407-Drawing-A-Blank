Perisisting Issues

Fix proper key usage in caaches
    currently only works based on zoomLevel
    needs to work for view location also
        so 2 keys to an entry - or longlatzoomlevel as string and low precision long lat
        can use less precision on location and make the area bounds be represneted in precision

Determine best caching scheme
    new entry for each location
    fill a larger grid on globe, 
        always issue of what to do on cache boundary
        as should technically render from both regions 
            perhaps best is just to minimize number of bounaries
            i.e. bigger entry grids/ regions
            OR
            make cache entries smaller and just render ALL the cache entries in the region
                just get the first grids at any tile size first (for immediate user progress)
                then can async load the correct tilesize

    Render all cached regions in the field of view
    not just the best region
